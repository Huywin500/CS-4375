# CS 4375 Intro to Machine Learning<br /><br />

[Overview of ML](Overview_of_ML.pdf) <br />
In this pdf, I describe my definition of machine learning and its components. I also provide my personal interest in the topic.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration Questions](Portfolio_Component_1_Questions.pdf) <br />
I perform basic data exporation functions in C++. These include getting statistics from the file input such as sum, mean, median, min, max, standard dev, covariance, and correlation.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration Questions](Portfolio_Component_1_Questions.pdf) <br /> 
I provide a screenshot of my output of the data exploration code. I also talk about my experience coding these functions compared and their relations to one another.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Linear Models](https://github.com/Huywin500/CS-4375/tree/main/Portfolio%20Linear%20Models) <br />
I worked with David Teran to perform classification and regression on specific data sets from kaggle in R.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Component 2: ML Algorithms from Scratch](https://github.com/Huywin500/CS-4375/blob/main/Portfolio%20Component%202%20Questions.pdf) <br />
I perform logistic regression and Naive Bayes in C++ compared to doing the algorithms in R.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Component: Searching for Similarity Notebook 4](https://github.com/Huywin500/CS-4375/blob/main/Notebook4.pdf)<br />
I perform a regression model on a wine data set and then applied PCA and LDA reduction on the model to see how it changes it.<br /><br />
[Portfolio Assignment: ML with sklearn](https://github.com/Huywin500/CS-4375/blob/main/Python%20ML%20with%20sklearn.pdf)<br />
Using python's sklearn, I created a logisitic regression, decision tree, and neural network model on car dataset.<br /><br /><br />

# Overall Thoughts on Machine Learning<br /><br />
I felt this class gave me the perfect oppotunity to dip into this field. With the rise of AI in most platforms, I felt that this was an important topic to look into. I will continue to learn about Machine learning to apply to future projects.<br /><br />
